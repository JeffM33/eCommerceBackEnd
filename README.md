<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project shows me using insomnia to hit endpoints, through different routes, and models i created to update a backend database. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Built With
Javascript

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
simply fork over the project, run an NPM I to install everything needed open up a git terminal in the database run mySql -u root. Then run source schema.sql in the mySql terminal. Then go back to your original git terminal and run npm run seed in order to seed the prearranged data I have for you. Then npm run start in order to start up your local host. From there you can use a web browser or insomnia to hit the different end points like i did in the video below.   

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

<!-- Prerequisites -->
I tested this through insomnia.
